This is a data processing module for the portfolio.

Store, keep and clean data.

Calling new data requires internet connexion.

For Alpha Vantage (AV), max 5 API requests per minute and 500 requests per day. More info on https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/.

For ESG Enterprise (ESGE), max 50 API requests per day. More info on https://www.esgenterprise.com/docs/api-reference/.

Methods
----------
boot()
    Loads names of supported stocks and cryptos. Tries to use AV and ESGE data in cache. If AV is outdated, makes a backup and loads empty dictionnary.
add(name)
    Add an entry to the portfolio to construct.
remove(name)
    Remove an entry from the portfolio of the user.
data_add(name)
    Try to call new data iif it is not already in storage.
data_store(name, dic)
    Store new data from API call in a dictionnary.
esg_add(name, dic)
    Try to call new ESG data iif it is not already in storage.
esg_store(name, dic)
    Store new ESG data from API call in a dictionnary.
construct_pf()
    Constructs the portfolio. Namely, properly call data_get().
data_get(names, data = pd.DataFrame())
    Construct a portfolio with logarithmic returns for given stock and cryptos, and a given horizon.
api_stock(name)
    Returns a dictionary of daily stock data through an AV API call.
api_crypto(name)
    Returns a dictionary of daily crypto data through an AV API call.
api_esg(name)
    Returns a dictionnary of ESG data for a given company through an ESGE API call.
