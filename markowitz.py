This is an optimization module. Simply calling the init method with at least two columns of data in a self.pfdta dataframe in log returns will satisfy the autopilot.

Methods
----------
markowitz_init()
    Creates a few variable based on the self.pfdta dataframe. This is a necessary preliminary step because markowitz_speedwagon does not understand dataframes. It directly runs markowitz_speedwagon() and markowitz_turtle().
markowitz_speedwagon(assets, mean, covariance)
    Runs a simple Monte-Carlo simulation and also extracts the highest Sharpe ratio out of it. It tries to be fast!
markowitz_turtle(assets, mean, covariance, mus)
    Runs a first non-linear optimization to estimate the efficient frontier, and a second one to estimate the best portfolio according to the Sharpe ratio measure. The name of the function is a bit misleading, it is not that slow.
